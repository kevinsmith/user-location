# UserLocation

A simple library to get the current user's location, with an optional fallback method of obtaining their coordinates.

It can be messy, convoluted work to get a user's location and cache it for quick retrieval later if you write the code yourself. It only makes sense to package it up into an easy-to-use library. So that's what I did.

Lookup methods include:
- exact location (within ~30m), but it requires the user's permission
- general location (within ~10km) without user input

## Requirements

UserLocation requires support for ES2015 Promises and the Fetch API. I recommend GitHub's [Fetch polyfill](https://github.com/github/fetch) and the [ES6-Promise polyfill](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise) to bring the following browser support:

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 42.0+
- Firefox 39+
- Internet Explorer 10+
- Opera 29+
- Safari 6.1+

**Note:** For front-end use only. Not compatible with a Node.js server-side environment.

## Quick Example

Since location lookup isn't an instant operation, UserLocation uses a [promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) to deliver coordinates as soon as they're available.

```
var location = new UserLocation({
  cacheTtl: 300,
  fallback: 'exact'
});

location
  .then(function(coords) {
    console.log(coords);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    throw new Error(err);
  });
```

## Installation

UserLocation can be loaded as a standard ES2015 module or through a module loader that supports AMD or CommonJS formats.

RequireJS (AMD module loader):

```
// Assuming UserLocation.min.js is in the same folder as this script
requirejs(['UserLocation.min'], function(UserLocation) {
  var location = new UserLocation({...
});
```

Browserify (CommonJS module loader):

```
// Assuming UserLocation.min.js is in the same folder as this script
var UserLocation = require('./UserLocation.min');

var location = new UserLocation({...
```

Or simply include the library via a script tag for access to `UserLocation` as a global.

```
<script src="UserLocation.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var location = new UserLocation({...
</script>
```

## Usage

### Options

A configuration object is not required when instantiating UserLocation, but there are a few options available.

```
var location = new UserLocation({
  option: value
});
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|-------------|----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cacheTtl | number | 604800 | Cache time-to-live in seconds. (Default is 7 days.) |
| fallback | boolean/string | false | Method of obtaining coordinates if initial try fails. Possible values: false, 'general', or 'exact'. |
| specificity | string | 'general' | Initial method of obtaining coordinates. Possible values: 'general' or 'exact'. |                    |

### Return

UserLocation returns a promise, so be sure you understand [how ES2015 promises work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). In short, you can call the `.then()` method on the promise with an anonymous function that takes the returned coordinates as the first argument, like so:

```
location.then(function(coords) {
  // do something with coords
});
```

This ensures you're not trying to make use of the coordinates before they're available. Promises are a big improvement over the old callback pattern because you can use the promise's results repeatedly throughout your code, whereas a callback is a once-and-done situation.

```
location.then(function(coords) {
  // make use of coordinates in one place
});

// ...

location.then(function(coords) {
  // do something else with those coords in a totally different place in your code
});
```

## Bug Reports

If you think you've found a bug, please post a good quality bug report in [this project's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kevinsmith/user-location/issues). Quoting from [Coen Jacobs](https://coenjacobs.me/2013/12/06/effective-bug-reports-on-github/), this is how you can best help me understand and fix the issue:

- The title **explains the issue** in just a couple words
- The description **is detailed enough** and contains at least:
  - **steps to reproduce** the issue
  - what the expected result is and **what actually happens**
  - the **version** of the software being used
  - versions of **relevant external software** (e.g. browser and operating system)
- Explain **what youâ€™ve already done** trying to fix this issue
- The report is **written in proper English**
